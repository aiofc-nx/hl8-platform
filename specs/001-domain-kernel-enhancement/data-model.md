- Timestamp must be valid Date
- Correlation ID must be non-empty string

**State Transitions**: Mutable - can be updated during operation execution

### CoordinationResult

**Purpose**: Represents the result of coordinated operations with success status and data

**Fields**:

- `success: boolean` - Whether operation succeeded

**State Transitions**: Immutable - no state changes after creation

## Data Integrity Rules

1. **Validation Rules**: All validation rules must have unique names within their scope
2. **Business Rules**: Business rules must have unique names and valid severity levels
3. **Coordination Rules**: Coordination rules must have unique operation names
4. **Business Operations**: Business operations must have unique names within their aggregate
5. **Event Handlers**: Event handlers must have unique event types or be composable

## State Transitions

### ValidationResult States

- `Created` → `Valid` (when validation passes)
- `Created` → `Invalid` (when validation fails)

### BusinessRuleValidationResult States

- `Created` → `Valid` (when all rules pass)
- `Created` → `Invalid` (when any rule fails)

### CoordinationResult States

- `Created` → `Success` (when operation succeeds)
- `Created` → `Failure` (when operation fails)

## Performance Considerations

- Validation rules designed for O(1) or O(n) complexity where n is rule count
- Business rule validation optimized for batch processing
- Coordination context designed for minimal memory footprint
- Event handlers optimized for fast execution

## Validation Rules

- All string fields must be non-empty
- All arrays must not be null (can be empty)
- All functions must be provided
- All dates must be valid
- All numeric values must be non-negative where applicable
