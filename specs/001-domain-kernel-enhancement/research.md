# Research: Domain Kernel Enhancement

**Feature**: Domain Kernel Enhancement  
**Date**: 2024-12-19  
**Phase**: 0 - Research

## Research Tasks

### Task 1: Validation Framework Architecture

**Research Question**: How to design a composable validation framework for value objects that maintains domain layer purity?

**Decision**: Use interface-based validation rules with composition support

**Rationale**:

- Interface-based approach allows for flexible rule definition without external dependencies
- Composition pattern enables reusable validation logic across different value objects
- Error collection provides comprehensive feedback for debugging
- Maintains domain layer purity by avoiding external validation libraries

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Decorator-based validation (rejected: requires external framework dependencies)
- Schema-based validation (rejected: too rigid for domain-specific rules)
- External validation libraries (rejected: violates domain layer purity)

### Task 2: Business Rule Management System

**Research Question**: How to implement business rule validation that supports different severity levels and context tracking?

**Decision**: Rule-based system with severity levels and violation context

**Rationale**:

- Rule-based approach makes business logic explicit and testable
- Severity levels (ERROR, WARNING) provide flexibility in rule enforcement
- Context tracking enables detailed error reporting and debugging
- Supports conditional rules for complex business scenarios

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Hard-coded validation (rejected: not flexible or maintainable)
- External rule engines (rejected: violates domain layer purity)
- Simple boolean validation (rejected: insufficient for complex business rules)

### Task 3: Domain Service Coordination Pattern

**Research Question**: How to coordinate complex operations across domain services without introducing framework dependencies?

**Decision**: Coordination rules with context-based execution

**Rationale**:

- Coordination rules provide declarative way to define complex operations
- Context-based execution allows for dependency injection without framework coupling
- Supports dependency validation and execution ordering
- Maintains service independence while enabling coordination

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Direct service calls (rejected: creates tight coupling)
- Event-driven coordination (rejected: adds complexity for simple operations)
- Framework-based orchestration (rejected: violates domain layer purity)

### Task 4: Aggregate Root Business Operations

**Research Question**: How to enhance aggregate roots with business operations while maintaining aggregate boundaries?

**Decision**: Business operation interface with pre/post condition validation

**Rationale**:

- Business operation interface provides standardized way to define complex operations
- Pre/post condition validation ensures operation integrity
- Event publishing integration maintains event-driven architecture
- Maintains aggregate boundaries while enabling complex business logic

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Direct method calls (rejected: no validation or event integration)
- Command pattern (rejected: adds unnecessary complexity)
- External orchestration (rejected: violates aggregate boundaries)

### Task 5: Domain Event Processing

**Research Question**: How to process domain events within the domain layer while maintaining purity?

**Decision**: Synchronous event processing with handler registry

**Rationale**:

- Synchronous processing maintains predictability and simplicity
- Handler registry allows for flexible event handling
- Pure domain processing avoids external dependencies
- Supports both simple and complex event handling scenarios

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Asynchronous processing (rejected: adds complexity, moved to application layer)
- External event buses (rejected: violates domain layer purity)
- Simple callback system (rejected: insufficient for complex scenarios)

## Technical Decisions Summary

1. **Validation Framework**: Interface-based rules with composition
2. **Business Rules**: Rule-based system with severity levels
3. **Service Coordination**: Coordination rules with context execution
4. **Aggregate Operations**: Business operation interface with validation
5. **Event Processing**: Synchronous processing with handler registry

## Performance Considerations

- Validation rules designed for <10ms execution
- Event processing optimized for <5ms completion
- Rule composition supports early termination for performance
- Context-based execution minimizes overhead

## Integration Points

- All enhancements integrate with existing domain kernel components
- Backward compatibility maintained for existing APIs
- New features follow established domain kernel patterns
- No external framework dependencies introduced

## Risk Mitigation

- Comprehensive testing strategy for all new features
- Performance benchmarks established for critical paths
- Error handling designed for graceful degradation
- Documentation ensures maintainability and adoption
