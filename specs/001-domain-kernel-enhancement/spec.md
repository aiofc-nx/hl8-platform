# Feature Specification: Domain Kernel Enhancement

**Feature Branch**: `001-domain-kernel-enhancement`  
**Created**: 2024-12-19  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "根据上述讨论内容创建libs/kernel/domain-kernel的改进方案"

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Enhanced Value Object Validation (Priority: P1)

As a domain developer, I want to create value objects with comprehensive validation rules so that I can ensure data integrity and catch validation errors early in the domain layer.

**Why this priority**: Value objects are fundamental building blocks of domain models. Robust validation prevents invalid data from entering the domain and provides clear error messages for debugging.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating value objects with various validation rules and verifying that invalid values are rejected with appropriate error messages.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a value object with multiple validation rules, **When** I create it with valid data, **Then** the object is created successfully
2. **Given** a value object with validation rules, **When** I create it with invalid data, **Then** a clear validation error is thrown with specific field information
3. **Given** a value object with complex validation rules, **When** I combine multiple rules, **Then** all rules are evaluated and all violations are reported

### User Story 2 - Business Rule Validation Framework (Priority: P1)

As a domain developer, I want to define and validate business rules on entities so that I can ensure business invariants are maintained throughout the domain model.

**Why this priority**: Business rules are core to domain logic. A systematic approach to rule validation ensures consistency and makes business logic explicit and testable.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating entities with business rules and verifying that rule violations are detected and reported appropriately.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an entity with business rules, **When** I perform an operation that violates a rule, **Then** a business rule violation exception is thrown
2. **Given** an entity with multiple business rules, **When** I validate all rules, **Then** all violations are collected and reported together
3. **Given** an entity with conditional business rules, **When** the conditions change, **Then** the appropriate rules are applied

---

### User Story 3 - Enhanced Domain Service Coordination (Priority: P2)

As a domain developer, I want to coordinate complex business operations across multiple domain services so that I can implement sophisticated domain logic while maintaining service boundaries.

**Why this priority**: Complex business operations often require coordination between multiple services. A clean coordination mechanism enables sophisticated domain logic while maintaining service independence.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating domain services with coordination rules and verifying that complex operations are executed correctly with proper error handling.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple domain services with coordination rules, **When** I execute a coordinated operation, **Then** all services are called in the correct order
2. **Given** a coordinated operation, **When** one service fails, **Then** appropriate error handling and rollback occurs
3. **Given** domain services with dependencies, **When** I register coordination rules, **Then** the system validates that all dependencies are satisfied

---

### User Story 4 - Enhanced Aggregate Root Business Operations (Priority: P2)

As a domain developer, I want to define complex business operations on aggregate roots so that I can encapsulate sophisticated business logic while maintaining aggregate boundaries.

**Why this priority**: Aggregate roots are the primary entry points for business operations. Enhanced operation support enables complex business logic while maintaining aggregate integrity.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating aggregate roots with business operations and verifying that operations execute correctly with proper validation and event handling.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an aggregate root with business operations, **When** I execute an operation, **Then** pre-conditions are validated before execution
2. **Given** an aggregate root with business operations, **When** an operation completes, **Then** post-conditions are validated and domain events are published
3. **Given** an aggregate root with complex operations, **When** I register operation handlers, **Then** the system validates operation dependencies and constraints

---

### User Story 5 - Enhanced Domain Event Processing (Priority: P3)

As a domain developer, I want to process domain events within the domain layer so that I can implement event-driven business logic while maintaining domain purity.

**Why this priority**: Domain events are crucial for implementing event-driven architecture. Pure domain event processing enables sophisticated business logic without external dependencies.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating domain events and event handlers and verifying that events are processed correctly within the domain layer.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a domain event and handler, **When** an event is published, **Then** the handler processes the event correctly
2. **Given** multiple event handlers, **When** an event is published, **Then** all relevant handlers are invoked
3. **Given** an event handler that fails, **When** an event is processed, **Then** appropriate error handling occurs without affecting other handlers

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when validation rules conflict with each other?
- How does the system handle circular dependencies in business rules?
- What occurs when domain event handlers throw exceptions?
- How does the system handle validation of deeply nested value objects?
- What happens when business operations have conflicting pre-conditions?

## Background & Principles

### Core Architecture Principles (from Original Spec)

#### 1. 充血模型原则

- **实体必须遵循充血模型模式**：实体不仅包含数据，更重要的是承载业务逻辑
- **业务逻辑内聚**：相关的业务逻辑应该封装在对应的实体中
- **状态与行为统一**：实体的状态变更必须通过业务方法进行

#### 2. 实体与聚合根分离原则 ⚠️ **强制性要求**

- **无论聚合简单或复杂，都必须实现实体与聚合根分离**
- **聚合根职责**：管理聚合边界，协调内部实体，发布领域事件，验证业务规则
- **内部实体职责**：执行具体业务操作，维护自身状态，遵循聚合根指令
- **禁止直接执行业务逻辑**：聚合根不能直接执行业务逻辑，必须委托给内部实体

#### 3. 分离模式的好处

- **业务会变化**：现在简单的聚合未来可能变复杂
- **架构一致性**：所有聚合都遵循相同模式，降低理解成本
- **可维护性**：分离模式使代码更易维护和扩展
- **团队规范**：统一的实现模式避免决策成本

### Event Processing Mode

- **默认**：领域层内同步处理（保持纯净与可预测性）
- **可扩展**：应用层/基础设施可将事件异步化（队列/总线），不影响领域模型契约
- **事件存储**：由上层实现事件持久化策略（遵循事件存储模式），领域层仅定义事件结构与不变量
- **参考**：原始规范附录见 `appendix-original-spec.md` 中的事件持久化与并发假设

### Domain Service Collaboration (DI-agnostic)

- **协作模型**：通过"协调规则 + 协作上下文（CoordinationContext）"完成跨聚合/服务的业务编排
- **输入输出**：显式传入依赖与实体，不依赖框架注入；输出统一为 `CoordinationResult`
- **纯净性**：不引入任何框架类型或运行时耦合；依赖由上层封装成接口/函数传入
- **兼容性**：原规范中"依赖注入"表述，等价映射为"依赖接口化 + 上下文注入"，见附录对照
