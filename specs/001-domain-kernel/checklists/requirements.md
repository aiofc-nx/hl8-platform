# Specification Quality Checklist: Domain Kernel Core Module

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2024-12-19
**Feature**: [spec.md](./spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All checklist items have been validated and pass
- Specification includes mandatory architectural principles:
  - 充血模型 (Rich Domain Model) pattern for entities
  - 实体与聚合根分离原则 (Entity-Aggregate Root Separation Principle)
- Added UUID v4 requirements for entity identifiers
- Added comprehensive audit capabilities for entities
- Architecture principles section added with clear separation of concerns
- Updated functional requirements to enforce separation pattern, UUID, and audit features
- Added new key entities: EntityId, AuditInfo, AuditTrail, UuidGenerator
- Updated success criteria to include UUID and audit performance metrics
- Specification is ready for planning phase
- No clarifications needed - all requirements are clear and complete
