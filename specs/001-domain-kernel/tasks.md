# Tasks: Domain Kernel Core Module

**Feature**: Domain Kernel Core Module  
**Branch**: `001-domain-kernel`  
**Generated**: 2024-12-19  
**Total Tasks**: 45

## Summary

This feature implements a domain kernel core module based on Clean Architecture principles, providing value objects, entities (rich domain model + UUID + audit), and aggregate roots (entity separation principle) as core domain layer components. The implementation uses TypeScript with event store patterns, optimistic locking, and business/system exception classification.

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP Scope

The MVP should focus on **User Story 1 (Value Objects)** as it provides the foundation for all other components. This includes:

- ValueObject base class implementation
- Immutability enforcement
- Equality comparison
- Serialization support

### Incremental Delivery

1. **Week 1**: Phases 1-3 (Setup, Foundational, Value Objects)
2. **Week 2**: Phases 4-5 (Entity Identifiers, Entities)
3. **Week 3**: Phases 6-7 (Aggregate Roots, Separation Principle)
4. **Week 4**: Phases 8-10 (Domain Events, Services, Polish)

### Parallel Development Opportunities

- **Value Objects** and **Entity Identifiers** can be developed in parallel
- **Entities** and **Aggregate Roots** can be developed in parallel after their dependencies
- **Domain Events** and **Domain Services** can be developed in parallel
- **Exception handling** can be developed alongside other components

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Each component has comprehensive unit tests
- **Integration Tests**: Cross-component functionality is tested
- **End-to-End Tests**: Complete user scenarios are validated
- **Performance Tests**: UUID generation and audit recording performance is verified

### Quality Gates

- All tests must pass before moving to next phase
- Code coverage must be >= 80% for core components
- Linting must pass with no errors
- Build must succeed without warnings
- Performance targets must be met (UUID 99.99%, Audit 99.99%, Response times)
